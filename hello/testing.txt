Hello, My name is Amandeep Singh,
I'm 22,
I live in Ghaziabad,
With my family,
But to tell you the truth my family actually hails from Delhi,
Right now I'm looking for Job as well as making myself more and more employable by learning more stuff,
By the way I'm a recent Graduate with a bachelors degree in Computer Application,
And my favorite hobbie is playing football with my friends,
that's it Thanks for asking cheers!!!
